# Security Policy

With the entirety of Waldo Vision, we attempt to make sure that we are as secure as possible, but sometimes things can slip through the cracks. If you find a security vulnerability, we ask that you let us know as soon as possible.

## Discloure Policy

- Let us know as soon as possible if you have found a vulnerability so we can fix it.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability before disclosing it to the public.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services. Please also only interact with your own test accounts and data, or gain explicit permission from the account holder.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability please make sure to let us know immediately through [Github Advisories](https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo/security/advisories/new) or if that does not work for you, please get in contact with us though our [email](mailto:security@waldo.vision).
